# Integer Programming with PuLP

This repository contains examples and explanations of various integer programming problems solved using PuLP, a linear programming modeler written in Python.

## Contents

**Knapsack Problem**
  Classic optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

**A Capital Budgeting Problem**
  Optimization problem focused on selecting a combination of investment projects to maximize total net present value (NPV) while staying within budget constraints.

**Fixed Charge Problem**
  Example:
    Scenario involving fixed setup costs and variable production costs. The goal is to decide which projects to set up and how much to produce for each to maximize profit.

**Minimum Lot Size**
  Example:
    Scenario where each product has a minimum production lot size, with fixed setup costs and variable profits. The objective is to maximize profit while meeting minimum lot size requirements.

**Quantity Discount**
  Example:
    Scenario involving purchasing quantities of products with different price levels depending on the quantity. The goal is to minimize the total cost while considering resource constraints and maximum sales limits.

**Discrete Price Levels**
    Example demonstrating the impact of discrete price levels on purchasing decisions.

**Continuous Pricing Single Product**
    Example exploring continuous pricing strategies for a single product.

**Multiple Products with IC Constraints**
    Example dealing with multiple products and integer constraints on production quantities.
